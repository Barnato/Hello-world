10. Divide stores up so that stores with msa populations between 1 and 100,000 are labeled 'very small', 
stores with msa populations between 100,001 and 200,000 are labeled 'small',
stores with msa populations between 200,001 and 500,000 are labeled 'med_small', 
stores with msa populations between 500,001 and 1,000,000 are labeled 'med_large', 
stores with msa populations between 1,000,001 and 5,000,000 are labeled “large”, 
and stores with msa_population greater than 5,000,000 are labeled “very large”. 
What is the average daily revenue (as defined in Teradata Week 5 Exercise Guide) 
for a store in a “very large” population msa?

Answer: very large 25451.53

    SELECT(SUM(rev)/sum(td)) AS dailyrevenue,
    CASE WHEN st.msa_pop>=1 AND st.msa_pop<=100000 THEN 'very_small' 
    /*Case is used for if/then statements and is used to extract multiple column names with the above 
    extracting population data and catgeorizing into groups from 'small' to 'large'*/
    WHEN st.msa_pop>=100001 AND st.msa_pop<=200000 THEN 'small' 
    WHEN st.msa_pop>=200001 AND st.msa_pop<=500000 THEN 'med_small'  
    WHEN st.msa_pop>=500001 AND st.msa_pop<=1000000 THEN 'med_large'
    WHEN st.msa_pop>=1000001 AND st.msa_pop<=5000000 THEN 'large'
