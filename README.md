# Hello-world
SQL Practice

This is a personal repository of SQL code samples including:

•	SELECT queries produced for the Coursera/Duke course Managing Big Data with MySQL

•	SELECT queries as part of Hackerrank challenges

•	Creation of databases as part of my work with Code-Mates, a programming meet-up group based in Austin.
