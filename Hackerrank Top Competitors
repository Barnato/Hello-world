Julia just finished conducting a coding contest, and she needs your help assembling the leaderboard! 
Write a query to print the respective hacker_id and name of hackers who achieved full scores for more than one challenge. 
Order your output in descending order by the total number of challenges in which the hacker earned a full score. 
If more than one hacker received full scores in same number of challenges, then sort them by ascending hacker_id.
Only hacker 90411 managed to earn a full score for more than one challenge, so we print the their hacker_id and name 
as  space-separated values.


SELECT s.hacker_id,h.name FROM HACKERS h JOIN SUBMISSIONS s ON h.hacker_id=s.hacker_id 
JOIN CHALLENGES c ON s.challenge_id=c.challenge_id
JOIN DIFFICULTY d ON c.difficulty_level=d.difficulty_level
 /*selects those hackers with full scores because difficulty table only includes 
 difficulty levels with their corresponding full scores*/
WHERE s.score=d.score
  /*further selects those hackers with full scores because difficulty table only
  includes difficulty levels with their corresponding full scores*/
GROUP BY s.hacker_id, h.name 
HAVING COUNT(s.score)>1 ORDER BY COUNT(s.score) DESC, s.hacker_id ASC;
