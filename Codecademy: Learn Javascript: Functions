1.Imagine you work at a pizza restaurant and you want to write a JavaScript program to take orders so you don't have to write orders by hand. You can write a function to perform this task!

Start by writing a function using the keyword const and the name takeOrder. Then set the variable = to a set of parentheses followed by an arrow () =>. Inside of its block {}, use console.log() to print 'Order: pizza'.

2. Under the function, let's take an order. Call the takeOrder() function on the last line. 

Result:

Order: pizza.

if (age += 19 && registeredearly) {
console.log('1000', raceNumber);
}
if (age += 25 && registeredearly) {
  console.log('you will run at 9:30am', raceNumber);
}
if (age += 25 && !registeredearly) {console.log('you will run at 11:00am', raceNumber);
if (age == 16 && registeredearly) {console.log('you will run at 12:30pm', raceNumber);}
if (age == 16 && registeredearly) {console.log('you will run at 12:30 pm', raceNumber);}
                                   }
if (age +=19 && registeredearly) {console.log('you will race at 9:30am', raceNumber);}

  else if (age +=19 && !registeredearly) { console.log('you will race at 11:00am', raceNumber);
  }

else if (age < 18) {
  console.log('you will race at 12:30pm', raceNumber);
