This blog is to document CodeMates, a programming group that meets every Saturday. We are based in Austin. 
There are four people. Matt Elliot (Developer 1) and 
Tim Macaulay-Robinson (Developer 2) who have 20 years+ each experience. 
Vicky Barnato (me) & Travis Austin who are non techs. Both of us come from 
BA backgrounds and are programming novices. 
 
Our goals: 
Matt Elliot: Enhance tech communication and training skills by getting two civilians ready for programming jobs in a year. 
Tim Macaulay-Robinson: Ditto. 

Vicky Barnato (me) & Travis Austin:  Travis wants to move from Business Analysis to programming. 
I want to be less dependent on developers’ explanations to understand how technology works. 
This blog documents the projects and tasks that Tim and Matt set Travis and me to teach us.  
These will be basic tasks at first. Readers with programming experience may find the first couple of posts too basic. 
Please be patient we are novices! The first part of this post documents how I attempted to create an online guestbook form. 
Please let me know if you see any mistakes or  want additional explanations. 
SQL was used for the database, html for the form and PHP to connect the two. 

Note: We are using Cloud9 as a collaborative space.

The task was broken down by Tim into these steps:
0. Create database "guestbook" with 1 table "guest_"
    - Guest name should be a text column
1. Create html form, text input, and button
    - form should post data to php file insert_guest.php
2. Open connection to mysql using php mysql
3. Insert guest name into database
    - write the insert statement to insert the guests name into the database
    - submit the query to the database using the php mysql connection
    
My code:

CREATE DATABASE guestbook2;
//You should see this message: “Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)”
USE guestbook2
//You should see this message “Database changed”
CREATE TABLE guest (
guestID int,
guestname text,
sign_date date,
comments varchar(30),
reason varchar(30)
);
//You should see this message "Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)"

Below is the html form guestbook2.php where guests will input data:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
  
<form action="insert_guest.php" method="POST">
  <!-- guestname:<br>
  <input type="text" name="guestname">
  <br>
  <input type="button" onclick="formSubmit()" value="Send form data!">
  <input type="submit" name="Click me HARDER BABY"/>
  <br> -->
  survey:<br>
  
  Guest Name:
  <input type="text" name="guestname">
  <br>
  Did you have a good stay? <input type="text" name="comment">
  <br>
  why or why not?
  <input type="text" name="reason">
  <br>
  <input type="submit" value="submit"/>
<br>

Below is the code from insert_guest.php file which sets up the connection between the guestbook2 database and the html form

$conn = mysqli_connect("localhost","username","password","guestbook2");
//you will need to input username and password to set up the connection

// Check connection
if (mysqli_connect_errno())
  {
  echo "Failed to connect to MySQL: " . mysqli_connect_error();
  }
  // not used connection
// $myPDO = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=guestbook2', 'username', 'password'); 

if ($_POST) {
  
  $sql="INSERT INTO guest (guestname, comments, reason) VALUES ('".$_POST['guestname']."', '".$_POST['comment']."', '".$_POST['reason']."')";

  if ($conn->query($sql) === TRUE) {
      echo "New record created successfully";
  } else {
      echo "Error: " . $sql . "<br>" . $conn->error;
  }
}
?>
