A median is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to  decimal places.

I solved this using two (2) solutions:

First, find out the number of northern latitudes, the table contains. You do this by counting the number of rows containing Northern Latitudes.

SELECT COUNT(LAT_N) FROM STATION;

Answer: 499 rows

You know that the median lies between the 249th and 250th row. So you need to exclude the first 249 rows or 249 northern latitudes.
OFFSET excludes sets of records. The below says return only one record starting on the 250th record.

SELECT
ROUND(LAT_N, 4)
FROM
STATION
ORDER BY
LAT_N
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 249;
